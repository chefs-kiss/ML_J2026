**Due: Monday, Feb 17th at start of class**

Complete the following exercises. Remember to explain your answers.

## Question 1: Titanic Dataset

For this exercise, you will use the titanic dataset ([see: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)). You may have to sign-in using your Google account to view the data. Use the train.csv dataset on the Data tab to inform your answers below.

### Part (a)
Give an example of a record. What does it represent?

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

### Part (b)
Suppose you are using this dataset to train a model that will use a passenger class, sex, age, and fare to predict whether or not they will survive.

#### i. Classification or Regression?
Is this a classification task or a regression task? Explain your answer.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### ii. Features
What are the features? Explain your answer.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### iii. Targets
What are the targets? Explain your answer.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### iv. Null Model Accuracy
We call a model a null model if it predicts all observations (regardless of any features selected) as the target variable. For this dataset, the null model is a model that would label all records in our data as survived. What would be the accuracy of this null model's predictions?

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### v. Expected Performance
Would you expect a model using passenger class, sex, age, and fare to predict whether or not a passenger would survive to give a better accuracy than the null model? Explain why or why not.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*

## Question 2: Summary Statistics

In your own (non-technical) words, explain what each of the following summary statistics measures.

### Part (a): Mean

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

### Part (b): Median

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

### Part (c): Standard Deviation

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

### Part (d): Mode

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

## Question 3: Working with Data Sets

You are given the following sets of five numbers, each with a mean and median of 3.

- **SetA:** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- **SetB:** {3, 3, 3, 3, 3}
- **SetC:** {1, 1, 3, 5, 5}

For each of the examples below, give a brief explanation for each of the choices made.

### Part (a): Sum of Numbers
What is true about the sum of all numbers for each set? Which measure tells us why this is occurring?

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

### Part (b): Standard Deviation Ordering
Order the sets from smallest standard deviation to largest. Explain (non-technical, no math) why this is.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

### Part (c): Mean 3, Median 4
Create a set where the mean is 3, but the median is 4. Keep all numbers in the set between 0 and 5.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

### Part (d): Mean 3, Median 0
Create a set where the mean is 3, but the median is 0. Why must this set contain numbers higher than 5?

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

## Question 4: Statistical Tests

For this exercise, you will use the titanic dataset to understand the relationships between different variables and draw meaningful conclusions using statistical tests. Your task is to use the given information to understand what each test is doing. You will then fill in the missing information for selecting a feature pair for each statistical test, forming hypotheses, and interpreting the results.

### Part (a): t-test

#### i. Features used

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### ii. What the test is doing
It's checking if the average age of survivors differs significantly from the average age of non-survivors.

#### iii. Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### iv. Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### v. How to interpret this test

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### vi. What to do if test is significant
If the result is significant, you could explore further by examining the age distribution for each group (survivors vs. non-survivors). You could create visualizations to check if the distribution is skewed or if there are specific age ranges that were more likely to survive.

### Part (b): chi-square test

#### i. Features used

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### ii. What the test is doing

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### iii. Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### iv. Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)
There is a significant association between passenger class and survival status.

#### v. How to interpret this test

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### vi. What to do if test is significant

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

### Part (c): correlation test

#### i. Features used
age and fare

#### ii. What the test is doing

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### iii. Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### iv. Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
 
*Write your answer here*
:::

#### v. How to interpret this test
If the p-value is small, you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between age and fare. If the correlation coefficient is close to 1 or -1, the relationship is strong, while a coefficient near 0 indicates no significant relationship.

#### vi. What to do if test is significant

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
