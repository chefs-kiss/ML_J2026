If you have already registered with Disability and Access (DAC) and have your letter of accommodations, please meet with me as soon as possible to discuss, plan, and implement your accommodations in the course. If you have or think you have a disability (learning, sensory, physical, chronic health, mental health or attentional), please contact Disability and Access staff at 507-786-3288 or by visiting https://wp.stolaf.edu/academic-support/dac. ## Multilingual Students I am committed to making course content accessible to all students. If English is not your first language and this causes you concern about the course, please speak with me. Students who would like extra support with writing or speaking in English can also contact the language specialist (berryag@stolaf.edu) in CAAS. ## Managing stress, anxiety, and other issues I greatly value your experience in this class, and it is my duty to facilitate a safe, caring, and productive learning environment. I recognize that you may experience a range of emotional, physical, and/or psychological issues, both in and out of the classroom, that may distract you from your learning. If you are experiencing such issues, please do not hesitate to come see me – I am here to listen. We can also discuss what further resources might be available to you. ## Plagiarism & Academic Integrity Plagiarism, the unacknowledged appropriation of another person’s words or ideas, is a serious academic offense. It is imperative that you hand in work that is your own, and that cites or gives credit to others whenever you draw from their work. This includes citing prompts when using genAI tools or an internet search. Please see St.Olaf’s statements on academic integrity and plagiarism at: https://wp.stolaf.edu/thebook/academic/integrity/. See also the description of St.Olaf’s honor system at: https://wp.stolaf.edu/honorcouncil/. ## Communication Expectations: • Instructor/Student Expectations: I check my email frequently, and attempt to respond to questions within 24 hours. It should not be expected that I check my email after 9 PM, on Saturdays, or regularly during breaks. • E-mail Etiquette: If you have multiple questions, fewer emails with more information per email is preferred. Please include the following when sending an email: course number with section number, a description of your question(s) within the subject line, a greeting and your instructors preferred name (mine is Kim), and a sign-off using your preferred name (this is what you want others to refer to you in class by). Add screenshots of your work for clarity. ## The St. Olaf Honor System The St. Olaf Honor System has been in place at St. Olaf College since 1911. All tests, quizzes, and examinations of any kind are taken under the St. Olaf Honor System. Each student is responsible for adhering to all principles of the Honor System regardless of the individual circumstances associated with their assessment environment."

This article shows how we can initially interpret visualizations, and perhaps how to start questioning if the visualization is telling the story we think it is.\nUsing LLMs to storyboard goes through the process of how a data-driven story is created at The Pudding, but using an LLM. This article is a great way to understand how data-driven stories are put together, and how good (or not so good) LLMs are at replicating tasks associated with the design and implementation process.\nggplot vs plotnine compares the graphing power of R’s ggplot to Python’s plotnine (R wrapper for ggplot). Useful for those who have experience with creating visualizations in R, or for those who are unimpressed by matplotlib’s capabilities. Only read if you have a background using R. The following cheatsheets may be helpful for your reference: data storytelling, data visualizations, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn."

    "text": "Due: start of class on the day indicated on the syllabus  Complete the following exercises. Remember to explain your answers.\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, you will use the titanic dataset \\(\\href{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic}{(see:https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)}\\). You may have to sign-in using your Google account to view the data. Use the train.csv dataset on the Data tab to inform your answers below. You can also find the csv here\n\nGive an example of a record. What does it represent? \nSuppose you are using this dataset to train a model that will use a passenger class, sex, age, and fare to predict whether or not they will survive. \n\nIs this a classification task or a regression task? Explain your answer. \nWhat are the features? Explain your answer. \nWhat are the targets? Explain your answer. \nWe call a model a null model if it predicts all observations (regardless of any features selected) as the target variable. For this dataset, the null model is a model that would label all records in our data as survived. What would be the accuracy of this null model’s predictions? \n\nWould you expect a model using passenger class, sex, age, and fare to predict whether or not a passenger would survive to give a better accuracy than the null model? Explain why or why not. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your own (non-technical) words, explain what each of the following summary statistics measures: \n\nmean:\nmedian:\nstandard deviation:\nmode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are given the following sets of five numbers, each with a mean and median of 3. \\[\n\\text{SetA: } \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} \\qquad\n\\text{SetB: } \\{3,3,3,3,3\\} \\qquad\n\\text{SetC: } \\{1,1,3,5,5\\}\n\\] For each of the examples below, give a brief explanation for each of the choices made.\n\nWhat is true about the sum of all numbers for each set? Which measure tells us why this is occurring? \n\nOrder the sets from smallest standard deviation to largest. Explain (non-technical, no math) why this is.\n\nCreate a set where the mean is 3, but the median is 4. Keep all numbers in the set between 0 and 5. \n\nDo part c again, but where the median is 0. Why must this set contain numbers higher than 5? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, you will use the titanic dataset to understand the relationships between different variables and draw meaningful conclusions using statistical tests. Your task is to use the given information to understand what each test is doing. You will then fill in the missing information for selecting a feature pair for each statistical test, forming hypotheses, and interpreting the results.\n\nt-test\n\nFeatures used:\nWhat the test is doing: It’s checking if the average age of survivors differs significantly from the average age of non-survivors\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)):\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)):\nHow to interpret this test:\nWhat to do if test is significant: If the result is significant, you could explore further by examining the age distribution for each group (survivors vs. non-survivors). You could create visualizations to check if the distribution is skewed or if there are specific age ranges that were more likely to survive.\n\nchi-square test\n\nFeatures used:\nWhat the test is doing:\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)):\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): There is a significant association between passenger class and survival status\nHow to interpret this test:\nWhat to do if test is significant:\n\ncorrelation test\n\nFeatures used: age and fare\nWhat the test is doing:\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)):\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)):\nHow to interpret this test: If the p-value is small, you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between age and fare. If the correlation coefficient is close to 1 or -1, the relationship is strong, while a coefficient near 0 indicates no significant relationship.\nWhat to do if test is significant:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive an example of a set of five numbers with a mean of 3. Demonstrate that your setof numbers has this property, by computing the relevant summary statistics.\nGive an example of a set of five numbers with a mean of 3, and a very small standard deviation. Demonstrate that your set of numbers has this property, by computing the relevant summary statistics.\nGive an example of a set of five numbers with a mean of 3, and a very large standard deviation.

Demonstrate that your set of numbers has this property, by computing the relevant summary statistics.\nGive an example of a set of five numbers with a mean of 3 and a median of 0. Demonstrate that your set of numbers has this property, by computing the relevant summary statistics.\nGive an example of a set of 10 numbers with a mean of 5 and a symmetric distribution. Demonstrate that your set of numbers has this property, by computing the relevant summary statistics and making a dot plot.\nGive an example of a set of 10 numbers with a mean of 5 and a left-skewed distribution.Demonstrate that your set of numbers has this property, by computing the relevantsummary statistics and making a dot plot.\nGive an example of a set of 10 numbers with a mean of 5 and a right-skewed distribution.
